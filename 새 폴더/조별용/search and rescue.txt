SEARCH AND RESCUE UAV SYSTEMAND
METHOD
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
0001 Fires, storms, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, and the
like can create disaster situations that require search and
rescue operations and even recovery operations. For
example, Survivors can become trapped and buried within
debris and rubble as a result of these disaster situations.
Additionally, search and rescue operations are also required
when individuals become lost or are otherwise unable to
return. First responders organize search and rescue opera
tions to locate the trapped or lost survivors. Often, first
responders must travel through harmful conditions to find
and then help the survivors.
0002 Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones rep resent an evolving technology that is becoming more ubiq
uitous. Currently, UAVs are used for such disparate appli cations as toys and weapons platforms. They are even being
proposed for search and rescue applications. For example,
thermal imaging kits are available to augment the imaging capabilities of standard consumer/hobbyist grade UAVs for
search and rescue.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
0003. The present invention is directed toward solutions
to accelerate search efforts while reducing the risks to the
first responders and survivors. Specifically, the present
invention system includes UAVs, or other type of unmanned
vehicles, having sensors for detecting the presence of Sur
vivors in a search and rescue area. For example, these sensors allow UAVs to locate survivors buried in debris of
an infrastructure damaged by earthquakes, storms, fires, etc.
The UAVs of the present invention can also include UAV
data link transceivers for wirelessly communicating infor
mation concerning the Survivors to command centers. For
example, these UAV data link transceivers allow UAVs to
wirelessly communicate Survivor vital signs telemetry data
to mobile command centers (e.g., fire trucks). In general, the
present system provides a solution that speeds up search and
rescue operations to Survivors while reducing or mitigating
danger to first responders and Survivors.
0004. In general, according to one aspect, the invention
features an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), including: an
ultra-wide band (UWB) transceiver sensor for detecting a
presence of a Survivor in a search and rescue area and a UAV
data link transceiver for wirelessly communicating informa
tion concerning the Survivor to a command center.
0005. The information concerning the survivor can
include Survivor Vital signs telemetry data. For example, the
survivor vital signs telemetry data include the heart and/or
respiration rate of the survivor. In embodiments, the UAV
data link transceiver is configured to wirelessly communi
cate the information concerning the survivor via a UAV
command data link to the command center.
0006 Preferably, the UAV further includes an inter-UAV
data link transceiver for wirelessly communicating informa
tion concerning the survivor to another UAV.
0007 Preferably, the UAV further includes a medical
Supply compartment for holding emergency medical Sup
plies. The medical Supply compartment is configured to
release medical supplies to the survivor based on the
detected presence of the survivor.
Mar. 30, 2017
0008. The UAV can also include a UAV local positioning system module for determining the position of the UAV
within the area. In examples, the module can receive or
generate local positioning signals from multiple local posi
tioning system portable antennas Surrounding the search and
rescue area for determining a position of the UAV in the
search and rescue area.
0009. The UAV can further include a proximity sensor for
detecting the presence of objects in the search and rescue
area. A gas sensor can also be included for detecting the
presence of different kinds of gases, along with a visible
light camera for detecting video.
0010. In general, according to another aspect, a search
and rescue system includes a command center and an
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV has at least one
sensor for detecting the presence of a Survivor in the search
and rescue area, and a UAV data link transceiver for wire
lessly communicating information concerning the Survivor
to the command center.
0011. The at least one sensor is preferably an ultra-wide
band (UWB) transceiver sensor.
0012 Preferably, the command center includes a 3-di
mensional mapping system for creating a 3-dimensional
contour map of the search and rescue area.
0013 Preferably, the system further includes a wide-area
modem for communicating over a cellular network.
0014. In general, according to another aspect, the search
and rescue method includes deploying an unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) having an ultra-wide band (UWB) trans
ceiver sensor in a search and rescue area. The UWB trans
ceiver sensor detects the presence of a Survivor in the search
and rescue area and the UAV wirelessly communicates
information concerning the Survivor to a command center.
(0015 Preferably, the method further includes determin
ing an ingress/egress path to the Survivor. The command
center can identify a hazardous condition in the determined ingress/egress path.
(0016 Preferably, the method further includes the UAV
requesting deployment of a substitute UAV if the UAV is
damaged or trapped.
0017. The above and other features of the invention,

0026 FIG. 1A depicts a search and rescue system 10,
according to one embodiment of the present invention.
0027. The search and rescue system 10 includes
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) 12. As illustrated, the
UAVs 12 are deployed to search for survivors 40 in a search
and rescue area 14. In this example, a first UAV 12A and a
second UAV 12B are deployed. Other examples can include
deployment of one UAV 12, three UAVs 12, four UAVs 12,
or any other number of UAVs 12 as appreciated by one of
skill in the art.
0028. The UAVs 12 have sensors such as ultra-wide band
(UWB) transceiver sensors 26 for detecting survivors 40 in
the search and rescue area 14. In one example, the UWB
transceiver sensors 26 include radar technology Such as
UWB S-band multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
phased array radar systems. In this example, the UWB
transceiver sensors 26 include UWB impulse transmitters
that transmit UWB radio signals 30 in multiple directions.
The UWB radio signals 30 reflect off of objects and survi
vors 40 as reflected UWB radio signals 30R. The UWB
transceiver sensors 26 include receivers for detecting and
accepting the reflected UWB radio signals 30R. The UWB
transceiver sensors 26 detect Survivor vital signs telemetry
data as movement or phase shifts in the reflected UWB radio
signals 30R. For example, this detected movement of a
Survivor 40 can include walking and displacement of chest
due to respiration rate or heart rate. The respiration rate or
heart rate displacements can cause changes in frequency
values, phase values, amplitude values, and arrival time
values of the reflected UWB radio signals 30R compared to
Mar. 30, 2017
the transmitted UWB radio signals 30. The UWB transceiver
sensors 26 use these value changes to detect a presence of
survivors 40 as well as the vital signs telemetry data (heart
rates and/or respiration rates) of survivors 40. Further, the
UWB transceiver sensors 26 can determine a distance
between the UAVs 12 and survivors 40 based on the time
difference between transmission of the UWB radio signals 30 and receipt of the reflected UWB radio signals 30R from
survivors 40. This distance can be used in determining the
survivor's location.
(0029. UWB transceiver sensors 26 are capable of detect
ing Survivors through debris 41 (e.g., a concrete wall). The
UWB transceiver sensors 26 can generate UWB radio
signals 30 in a large spectral range at low frequencies which
enables the UWB radio signals 30 to penetrate through
concrete walls or other debris 41. For example, the UWB
transceiver sensors 26 can detect survivors 40 through a 10
cm thick concrete wall by using high-speed synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) imaging architecture. The UAVs 12
can use this technology to search for Survivors 40 through
debris 41.
0030 UAVs 12 include UAV local positioning system
(LPS) modules 35 that provide self positioning. UAVs 12 use the UAV LPS modules 35 to determine their UAV
locations in the search and rescue area 14. In one example, the UAV LPS modules 35 receive local position LP signals
37 from multiple LPS portable antennas 15A-15C surround
ing the search and rescue area 14. For example, the UAV
LPS module 35 determines a UAV location for the UAV 12
by triangulating the UAV location based on received LP
signals 37. In particular, the UAV LPS module 35 calculates
the time difference between transmission and receipt of an
LP signal 37. This time difference is a relative time delay for
the particular LPS portable antenna (e.g., first LPS portable
antenna 15A). The UAV LPS module 35 uses this time
difference to determine the distance between the UAV 12
and the first LPS portable antenna 15A. This distance
determination is repeated for the second and third LPS
portable antennas 15B-15C based on their respective time
delays. In this example, the UAV LPS module 35 triangu
lates its UAV location based on these determined distances
between the UAV 12 and each of the LPS portable antennas
15A-15C. Alternatively, the UAV LPS module 35 can deter
mine the UAV location by transmitting signals which are
triangulated from the antennas. The UAV 12 can determine
the survivor location based on the UAV location and dis
tance and angle between the UAV 12 and survivor 40.
0031. The UAVs 12 wirelessly communicate information
concerning the survivor 40 to other UAVs 12 via inter-UAV
data links 44. Each UAV 12 includes an inter-UAV data link
transceiver 24 that enables communication via the inter
UAV data links 44. The inter-UAV data links 44 can be IEEE
802.11. The UAVs 12 use the inter-UAV data link transceiv
ers 24 to continuously communicate with one another during search and rescue operations. For example, this inter-UAV
communication eliminates potential overlap searching by a
second UAV 12B as well as provides a way for other UAVs
12 to confirm accuracy of survivor detection by a first UAV
12A.
0032. The UAVs 12 wirelessly communicate information
concerning the Survivor 40 (e.g., Survivor location) to a
mobile command center 16 via a UAV-command data link
42. Each UAV 12 includes a UAV data link transceiver 25
that enables communication with the mobile command
US 2017/0O88261 A1
center 16. The UAV-command data link 42 can be a sub
gigahertz, data link Such as a radio frequency (RF) Sub
gigahertz, data link, Z-wave data link, Zigbee data link, or
other sub-gigahertz, data link. The mobile command center
16 monitors and controls the UAVs 12 by receiving and
sending data via the UAV-command data link 42.
0033. In one example, the mobile command center 16 is
located on a first responder vehicle 50 (e.g., onsite fire truck)
and communicates remotely from this location. The mobile
command center can be located at other remote locations as
appreciated by one of skill in the art.
0034. In the illustrated example, the mobile command
center 16 includes a number of components used in moni
toring and controlling the UAVs 12. The mobile command
center 16 has a mobile command center controller 49 for
directing and monitoring these components.
0035. The mobile command center 16 has a command
data link transceiver 58. The command data link transceiver
58 provides an access point for receiving and sending
information and data to and from the UAVs 12.
0036. The mobile command center 16 has a configurator computer workstation 18. The configurator computer work
station 18 includes a user interface for inputting commands
to direct the mobile command center 16 and/or UAVs 12.
0037. The mobile command center 16 has a mobile
command center control panel 20. The mobile command
center panel 20 can be used as an additional or alternative
user interface for directing the mobile command center 16
and/or UAVs 12. In one example, the mobile command
center panel 20 is in wireless communication with a campus alarm system via the campus network 54. The mobile
command center panel 20 can receive alarm information for
the different buildings 52A, 52B in the campus 52 from this
campus alarm system (i.e., monitor campus alarm system).
Further, the mobile command center panel 20 can be used to
control alarm devices on the campus alarm system.
0038. The system 10 can determine the UAV location
using indirect remote positioning technology. As described
above, the UAV LPS module 35 of the second UAV 12B
receives LP signals 37 from portable antennas 15C-15E. The
UAV LPS module 35 of the Second UAV 12B can determine
the signal distance for each portable antenna 15C, 15D, 15E
as described above based on time delays. Then, the UAV
LPS module 35 sends these signal distances as positioning
signals 43 to the LPS command center module 34 of the
mobile command center 16. Alternatively, the UAV LPS
module 35 forwards the measured time delays for each
portable antenna 15C, 15D, 15E as positioning signals 43.
The LPS command center module 34 positions the second
UAV location based on the received positioning signals 43
(signal distances or measure time delays). In particular, the
LPS command center module 34 triangulates the UAV
position of the second UAV 12B in the search and rescue
area 14 based on the signal distances for the portable
antennas 15C-15E. Alternatively, the LPS command center
module 34 can determine the UAV location by trilateration or multilateration.
0039. In another example, the UAV location can be
determined using remote positioning technology. In this
example, the UAV LPS module 35 is a transmitter that sends
LP signals 37. The portable antennas 15A-15C are receivers
for accepting the LP signals 37. Each receiver determines its
distance from the UAV 12 based on the time delay for the LP
signal 37 received as described above. The multiple receiv
Mar. 30, 2017
ers send these determined signal distances to a central site
Such as the mobile command center 16 for processing. The
mobile command center 16 triangulates, trilaterates, or mul
tilaterates the UAV position based on these determined
signal distances.
0040. In another example, the UAVs can be remotely
controlled by a user using feedback control. In this example, the UAV 12 positions itself based on trajectory tracking. In
particular, the UAV 12 is configured to track the trajectory
movement of a feedback controller and follow this move
ment in real-time. Thus, this type of local positioning technology relies on a feedback loop to position the UAV 12
continuously.
0041. Other local positioning technologies such as indi
rect self-positioning can be used as appreciated by one of
skill in the art.
0042. The mobile command center 16 includes a global positioning system (GPS) receiver 33. The GPS receiver 33
can calculate the mobile command center location (e.g.,
GPS coordinates) by receiving GPS information from GPS
satellites. In particular, the GPS receiver 33 uses the GPS
information to determine its distance to each satellite based
on time delay between transmission and receipt of the GPS
information. The GPS receiver uses these distances to
deduce its own location by using trilateration.
0043. The mobile command center 16 includes a 3-di
mensional site mapping system 53 for generating a map of
the search and rescue area 14. The 3-dimensional site
mapping system 53 receives the mobile command center
location from the GPS receiver 33 and/or the UAV location
from the LPS command center module 34. The 3-dimen
sional site mapping system 53 generates a 3-dimensional
contour map of the region relative to the mobile command
center location. The 3-dimensional site mapping system 53
can generate a 3-dimensional contour map of the region
relative to the UAV location. Also, the 3-dimensional site
mapping system 53 can generate a 3-dimensional contour
map that marks the UAV location relative to the mobile
command center location as well as the Survivor location.
The 3-dimensional site mapping system 53 can generate an
ingress/egress path from the mobile command center 16 to
the survivor.
0044. The mobile command center 16 communicates
with building controllers 17A, 17B via a system manager 48
in embodiments. The mobile command center 16 uses a
wide area modem 59 to communicate information remotely
to the system manager 48 via a wide area data link 46 (e.g.,
over a cellular network such as 4G LTE). The system
manager 48 is a router and server combination. The building
controllers 17A, 17B access information on the system
manager 48 via campus routers 56A, 56B (i.e., Internet
connection). For example, the campus routers 56A, 56B
connect to the Internet via a campus network 54.
0045. The building controller 17 may be located within a
building 52A, 52B at a campus 52. In the illustrated
example, a first building controller 17A is in building one
52A and a second building controller 17B is in building two
52B. The building controllers 17A, 17B access the campus
network 54 via respective campus routers 56A, 56B.
0046 FIG. 1B depicts the search and rescue system 10
showing further aspects of the present invention. As
described above, the UAVs 12 communicate with building
controllers 17 via UAV-command data links 42 (i.e., using
UAV data link transceivers 25).
US 2017/0O88261 A1
0047. In the illustrated embodiment, the search and res
cue system 10 include a remote control station 92. The
remote control station 92 is configured to monitor and
control the UAVs 12 remotely. For example, the remote
control station 92 runs interactive mobile applications and
services on a display that monitors and controls the UAVs
12. The interactive mobile applications and services provide
real-time or near real-time UAV status data, UAV location,
Survivor location, etc. Also, the interactive mobile applica tions and services can provide command options for con
trolling the UAVs 12. The remote control station 92 can
include a single display Such as a touch-screen display or
non-touch screen display for displaying information.
0.048. The remote control station 92 monitors and con
trols the UAVs 12 (first UAV 12A and second UAV 12B) via
the system manager 48 and building controller 17. In par
ticular, the remote control station 92 communicates with the
system manager 48 via a wide area data link 46 (e.g., 4G
LTE 46A or Wi-Fi 46B). Then, the system manager 48
converts this communication to compressed data and sends
the compressed communication to the building controller 17
via wire or wirelessly. The building controller 17 relays the
compressed communication to the UAVs 12 (e.g., first UAV
12A or second UAV 12B). Also, the building controller 17
relays information from the UAVs 12 to the system manager 48. The system manager 48 forwards this UAV communi
cation to the remote control station 92 via 4G LTE 46A or
Wi-Fi 46B links, in some implementations.
0049. As illustrated, the same building controller 17
receives building alarm information from fire alarm sensors
95. Fire alarm sensors 95 include fire pull alarm sensor 96A,
smoke detector sensor 96B, heat detector sensor 96C, and/or
suppression sensor 96D. The building controller 17 can
receive the building alarm information directly from the fire
alarm sensors 95 via a sensor-command data link 93. The
sensor-command data link 93 can be same type of link as the
UAV-command data link (e.g., Sub-gigahertz, data link).
Alternatively, the building controller 17 can receive the
building alarm information from a fire alarm panel 94. The
fire alarm sensors 95 communicate building alarm informa
tion to the fire alarm panel 94 via a sensor network 90. Then,
the fire alarm panel 94 forwards the building alarm infor
mation as “events' to the building controllers 17 via wire or
wirelessly.
0050 FIG. 2 shows a detailed view of various compo
nents in the UAV 12.
0051. The UAV 12 includes a UAV controller 31. The
UAV controller 31 monitors and controls UAV components which include various sensing mechanisms. For example,
the UAV controller 31 directs sensing mechanisms that are
used to detect survivors 40, determine location information,
navigate through the search and rescue area 14, identify
hazardous conditions in the search and rescue area 14, etc.
0052. The UAV 12 includes a locomotion system 39 for
moving the UAV. Typically, the locomotion system 39
includes at least one motor that powers jets, ducted systems, propellers or multiple rotor arms (e.g., multicopter UAVs
Such as bicopters, tricopters, quadcopters, pentacopters,
hexacopters, octocopters, Y4s, Y6s, Vtails, or Xes). For this
type of UAV 12, the locomotion system 39 controls move
ment by varying speed, pitch, and/or orientation of each
propeller causing variation in thrust and direction of flight.
In another example, the locomotion system 39 includes fixed
wings that provide lift similarly to an airplane (e.g., tail
Mar. 30, 2017
sitter UAV). In another example, the locomotion system 39
includes a propeller in a pusher configuration (e.g., fixed
wing aircraft). Other types of locomotion systems 39 can be
used with the UAV 12 as appreciated by one of skill in the
art. In fact, the vehicle need not be aerial. Walking or other
ground vehicles could also be used.
0053. The UAV 12 includes a speed sensor 21 used in
navigating the UAV 12. In particular, the speed, altitude and
direction sensor 21 continuously measures the speed, orien
tation and direction of the UAV 12. These measurements can
be fed into the UAV controller 31. The UAV controller 31
can instruct the locomotion system 39 to increase or
decrease thrust to achieve a desired speed for the UAV 12
compared to the measured speed. The speed sensor 21 can
use hall-effect sensors, voltage or current feedback of
motors, or other speed measurement systems.
0054) The UAV 12 includes a proximity sensor 27 for
detecting a presence of objects in the search and rescue area
14. The UAV controller 31 uses this information to navigate
the UAV 12 through the search and rescue area 14 by avoiding obstacles such as trees, boulders, etc. The UAV
controller 31 directs the UAV data link transceiver 25 to
wirelessly communicate information from the proximity
sensor 27 (e.g., detected presence of objects) to the mobile
command center 16.
0055. The UAV 12 can include a unidirectional micro
phone 23A and an omni-directional microphone 23B for
capturing audio data in the search and rescue area 14. The
unidirectional microphone 23A (e.g., cardioid microphone
or hypercardioid microphone) captures audio predominantly
from one direction. The omni-directional microphone 23B
captures audio evenly from all directions. In another
example, the UAV 12 includes a bidirectional microphone
which captures audio from two opposite directions. The
UAV controller 31 directs the UAV data link transceiver 25
to wirelessly communicate this audio data to the mobile
command center 16.
0056. The UAV 12A, 12B can also include a visible light
camera 22 for capturing video of the search and rescue area
14. The visual light camera 22 forms an image (i.e., gener
ates digital stills and video) by using visible light. The visual
light camera 22 typically operates in a 450 to 750 nanometer
range. For example, the visual light camera 22 is a charge
coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semi
conductor (CMOS) camera. The visual light camera 22 has
a variety of applications such as enabling the UAV 12 to
avoid obstacles, localization techniques, improved accuracy
of navigation, and video feedback. The visual light camera
22 has a video analytics system 29. The video analytics
system 29 can be used for image recognition and processing.
This video analytics system 29 can be used to confirm the
detection of survivors 40 by recognizing the survivors 40.
The UAV 12 communicates video from the visible light camera 22 to the mobile command center 16 via the UAV
data link transceiver 25.
0057 The UAV 12 includes an infrared (IR) camera 28
for Supplementing detection of Survivors 40 and navigation
through search and rescue area 14. The IR camera 28 forms
an image using infrared radiation. The IR camera 28 typi cally operates to detect light having wavelengths from 1 to
several micrometers, to as long as 14,000 nanometers, or
longer. In one example, the IR camera 28 is a thermal
imaging camera used to detect heat signatures of Survivors
40 and hotspots of fires. In another example, the IR camera
US 2017/0O88261 A1
28 provides night vision capabilities which help in navigat
ing the UAV 12. The IR camera includes either a cooled
infrared detector or uncooled infrared detector.
0058. The UAV 12 includes a gas sensor 38 for detecting
a presence of different kinds of gases. For example, the gas
sensor 38 can be used to supplement detection of survivors
40.
0059. In particular, the gas sensor 38 can detect carbon
dioxide levels which can be used to confirm detection of
survivors 40. The UAV data link transceiver 25 wirelessly communicates the detected presence of different gases to the
mobile command center 16.
0060. The UAV 12 includes a medical supply compart
ment 36 for holding emergency medical Supplies. The
medical Supply compartment 36 is configured to release
medical supplies to survivors 40 based on the detected
presence of the Survivor. For example, the medical Supply
compartment 36 can provide water, antibiotics, and/or drugs
to survivors 40 as instructed by the mobile command center
16. For example, a user can input this instruction at the
mobile command center 16 based on data received from the
UAVS 12.
0061. The UAV 12 can also include a GPS receiver 33.
This GPS receiver 33 functions the same as the GPS receiver
33 described above for the mobile command center 16. In
this example, the GPS receiver 33 calculates the UAV
location (e.g., GPS coordinates) by receiving GPS informa
tion from GPS satellites. The GPS receiver 33 supplements
the UAV LPS module in determining the UAV location.
0062 FIG. 4 illustrates types of information exchanged
between the mobile command center 16 and the first UAV
12A, the first UAV 12A and the second UAV 12B, as well
as the mobile command center 16 and a first responder 82
during operation of the system 10. FIG. 5 illustrates a flow
chart of the main steps included in the operation of the
system 10.
0063 Prior to step 100, UAVs 12 having the UWB
transceiver sensors 26, as described above, are deployed. In
step 100, the mobile command center 16 pre-loads a refer
ence location 60 (e.g., location of destroyed building) into
the first UAV 12A to be used in determining survivor
location 68. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the mobile
command center 16 sends the reference location 60 to the
first UAV 12A. The UAV LPS module 35 (FIGS. 1A, 1B) of
the first UAV 12A can use this reference location 60 as a
datum to calculate the first UAV location 70A as geo-spatial
coordinates for the first UAV 12A. Further, as described
above, the first UAV 12A can accurately determine the
survivor location 68 based on this calculated first UAV
location and the measured distance between the first UAV
12A and the survivor 40 (FIG. 1A).
0064. In step 102, the mobile command center 16 coor
dinates travel paths for each UAV 12A, 12B and uploads the
coordinated travel paths to respective UAV 12A, 12B. For
example, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the first UAV travel path 64
is uploaded to the first UAV 12A. The travel paths are
coordinated so that the second UAV 12B does not overlap and replicate areas searched by the first UAV 12A. This
coordination also optimizes the search operation.
0065 During the search and rescue operation, the UAV
12 can continuously send status information to the mobile
command center 16. For example, the first UAV 12A sends
a first UAV status 74 that can include various UAV perfor mance and device information. If the first UAV 12A is
Mar. 30, 2017
damaged (i.e., broken down) or trapped, the first UAV 12A
can request deployment of a substitute second UAV 12B
(step 104). This substitute deployment request may be sent
within the first UAV status 74 message. Alternatively, this
deployment request may be sent as a separate message from
the UAV status 74.
0066. In step 106, the first UAV 12A detects a presence
of a survivor and determines the survivor location 68. As
described above, the survivor location 68 is based on the
calculated first UAV location 70A and the measured distance
between the first UAV 12A and the survivor 40. As shown
in FIG. 3, the first UAV 12A can wirelessly transmit the
determined survivor location 68 to the mobile command
center 16.
0067. In step 108, wireless communication is provided
between the first UAV 12A and Second UAV 12B for
confirming and refining detection. In particular, these wire
less intercommunications between UAVs 12 refine the accu
racy of detection by confirming or refining whether Survi
vors 40 were correctly detected. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the
first UAV 12A communicates the first UAV location 70A and
survivor location 68 information to the second UAV 12B via
the inter-UAV data link 44. The second UAV 12B commu
nicates the second UAV location 70B to the first UAV 12A.
For example, based on this information the second UAV 12B can locate the first UAV 12A and/or the survivor location
and determine whether detection of the survivor 40 is
correct. The second UAV 12B sends a confirm/refine survi
vor detection message 72 to the first UAV 12A based on the
second UAVs determination of Survivor detection.
0068. In step 110, the first UAV 12A measures survivor
Vital signs telemetry data 62 (e.g., heart rate and respiration
rate) for the detected survivor 40. As shown in FIGS. 2-3, the
first UAV 12A wirelessly communicates the survivor vital
signs telemetry data 62 and survivor location 68 to the
mobile command center 16 (step 112). The mobile command
center 16 uses the survivor vital signs telemetry data 62 to
indicate the overall health condition of the identified survi
vor 40. In step 114, the mobile command center 16 instructs
UAV(s) 12 to provide emergency medical supplies to the
detected survivor 40 based on the survivor vital signs telemetry data 62. In particular, the mobile command center
16 sends a release medical supplies command 76 to the first
UAV 12A instructing the first UAV 12A to release relevant
medical supplies for the survivor 40. The medical supplies provide a temporary medical solution for the survivor 40
until first responders 82 can reach the survivor 40.
0069. In step 116, the mobile command center 16 deter
mines an ingress/egress path (i.e., safe path info 84) to the
survivor 40 and identifies hazardous conditions in the deter
mined path (i.e., hazards in path 88). Specifically, the mobile
command center 16 can use information received from the
UAVs 12 to locate and identify hazardous conditions in the
determined path to the survivor. The mobile command
center 16 can assess the path to the survivor 40 and provide
an alternate path if the originally determined path is not
usable.
0070 The mobile command center 16 forewarns first
responders 82 of the search and rescue area landscape and
Survivor health conditions via a display of the configurator
computer workstation 18. For example, as illustrated in FIG.
3, the first responder 82 can view survival vital signs telemetry data 62, a 3d location map 86, safe path info 84.
and hazards in path 88. The first responder 82 can use this
US 2017/0O88261 A1
information in making informed decisions, assessing the
response priority within the search and rescue area 14, and
providing timely medical attention to the affected survivor
40.
(0071. The UAVs 12 provide other information to the
mobile command center 16 that aid first responders 82 in
making informed rescue response decisions. As illustrated in
FIG. 3, visible image data 66, audio data 67, IR image data
78, and UWB data 80 are sent from the first UAV 12A to the
mobile command center 16. This information can be viewed
by first responders 82 at the mobile command center 16.
Such information allows first responders 82 to appropriately prioritize rescue response and other search and rescue deci
sions.
